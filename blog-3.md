Why Are Type Guards Necessary in TypeScript?
In TypeScript, type safety is one of the main benefits of using the language. However, sometimes we need to tell TypeScript which type a variable is at a certain point in our code. This is where type guards come in.Type Guards are expressions or functions that check the type of a variable and minimize scope of mistaking. They help TypeScript understand what type a variable is at runtime, preventing errors and improving code safety.TypeScript canâ€™t always figure out the type of a variable by itself, especially when dealing with union types or unknown types. Type guards help narrow down the possible types, so TypeScript can provide better type checking, autocompletion, and error detection.Type guards are necessary in TypeScript to ensure that your code is type-safe and avoid errors. They allow TypeScript to narrow down types at runtime, making your code more reliable and reducing bugs. Whether using typeof, instanceof, or custom type guard functions, they help TypeScript understand your variables and provide better checks.
